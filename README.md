2. Using a tool such as VSCode Live Server, open `index.html`. This MUST be opened using some sort of live server and will not run locally.
## About
The 10,000 "Things" is actually 10,000 curves in a flow field. You can comment out some lines of code (namely `s.noLoop()`) and change `Field` to `AnimatedField` to get a nice animated flow field.

# About
All SVG components are found at the bottom of the main.js file. To make the variations, I simply added parameters to `drawDesOrdres` which modify the SVG in various ways. 
For consistent and scalable transformations, I decided to use a function factory to allow for easy chaining. i.e. `transform().translate(10, 5).pivot(50, 50).rotate(45)`.

## About
Color is somewhat arbitrarily chosen, but can be thought of as a representation of the amount of "chaos" in each image. I admit it's not the most visually pleasing, 
but it is more interesting than a plain black drawing.

## About
It is 1:00am and I haven't slept much recently, so I'm too tired to come up with a description or to write how I got here. To me, this flow field looks like veins.
